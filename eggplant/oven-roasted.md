Many people have had some unfortunate encounter with eggplant where it turned too spongy, too bitter, or too soggy and overcooked

After roasting, add greek yogurt and oregano on top :)

select your eggplant
- it should be heavy for its size, and the skin should be tight and unblemished. I like to give the eggplant a gentle squeeze to feel for any dents or soft spots.

salt eggplant before cooking
- extracting excess moisture (and any bitterness out) while enhancing flavor
- Salt also breaks the eggplantâ€™s spongy texture, turning it more tender and creamy once cooked

Salting:
- Slice and add salt on each side
- Let the slices sit for about 30 minutes 
	- or so until you see some beads of water on the surface
- Be sure to wipe the eggplant dry and remove excess salt before cooking

#### Mediterranean oven-roasted eggplant

crispy - Slice the eggplant thinly (1-inch or even 3/4-inch slices)

roasting in a hot oven for about 35 minutes or until crispy and tender

For seasoning, I used a combination of thyme and [sumac.](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/sumac/) Then I added a good handful of fresh chopped parsley, toasted pine nuts and pomegranate seeds (ariles.)

go Greek with a touch of oregano and a dollop of [tzatziki sauce](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/) on top
