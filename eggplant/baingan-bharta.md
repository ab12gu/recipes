onions, garlic, ginger, green chiles, tomatoes, turmeric, coriander, Indian red chile powder, garam masala, and cilantro.

**Standard globe eggplant, Italian eggplant, or Indian eggplant** (skinny Japanese and Chinese varieties will collapse on the stove)

- **Medium-sized** (around 14 to 16 ounces)
- **Relatively uniform in girth** from top to bottom. If your eggplant is very skinny on top but very fat on bottom, the top will cook through much faster and collapse before the bottom can cook).
- **Relatively ripe/soft**. The softer the eggplant, the faster it will cook on the stove (about 15 minutes). If your eggplant is on the firm side, itâ€™ll still turn out great, but it will take closer to 30 minutes to cook.
