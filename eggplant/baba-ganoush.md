#### Ingredients

- Eggplant
	- Italian eggplant or the smallest glove eggplant 
		- less seeds and the flesh is tender and not bitter.
- Tahini paste
	- Tahini paste is made of toasted sesame seeds. I use [Soom tahini](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/organic-tahini-by-soom/) made of 100% roasted and pressed organic Ethiopian White Humera sesame seeds offering a creamy texture and a nutty flavor.
- **Garlic.** 1 to 2 fresh garlic cloves, depending on how garlicy you enjoy your dips.
- **Lemon juice**. Citrus gives this eggplant dip a nice lift. You can make it as subtle or lemony as you like.
- **Greek Yogurt** **(secret optional ingredient)** If youâ€™re going for a vegan baba ganoush, omit the yogurt, but otherwise it is a great way to thicken the dip, making it even more creamy, while also enhancing the color turning it from a deep beige to something a little brighter and more appealing.
- **Seasonings.** Salt and pepper, of course. If you like, add a bit of [Sumac](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/sumac/) and cayenne pepper for heat.
- [**Extra virgin olive oil.**](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product-category/olive-oil/) A drizzle of a rich and peppery extra virgin olive oil over this dip is the perfect way to finish it!
- **Garnish.** If you like, add toasted pine nuts and some chopped fresh parsley to serve.

#### Recipe

- Roast the eggplant in a high-heated oven.
	- Cut the eggplant in half and 
	- place it flesh side down on a large lightly-oiled baking sheet 
	- roast at 425 F for about 40 minutes or until the eggplant is very soft and cooked through
- **Cool** **and Drain Well**. Put the cooked eggplant in a colander and, using a knife, open it up a big so that it will cool quickly and drain its juices. Push down on the eggplant with the back of the spoon so that any excess water will drain well.
- When cool enough to handle, peel the charred skin and stem off the eggplant
- **Gently mix the eggplant with the tahini and remaining ingredients**
	- fully cooled and is rid of excess water
	- tahini (a good 1/4 cup for rich and nutty flavor), minced garlic, fresh lemon juice, and, the optional secret ingredient, about 1 tablespoon of Greek yogurt. Season with a good pinch of kosher salt, and if you like, a little [sumac](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/sumac/) and [Aleppo pepper](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/aleppo-pepper-aleppo-style-pepper/) or red pepper flakes
- drizzle with a good bit of extra virgin olive oil. Finish with toasted pine nuts and fresh parsley
- **Chill or set aside for a few minutes** to allow the flavors to meld and the dip to thicken (chilling will help it).
