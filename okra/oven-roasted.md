To reduce the sliminess of okra, choose small, young, green, firm okra pods

- Chop off both the ends. 
	- Chop the bhindi to Â¾ inch pieces.
	- Do not chop them too thin as they tend to turn slimy after adding to the pan.
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)
	- Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
- Add okra with:
	- olive oil
	- salt and pepper 
	- paprika
	- Additional spices:
		- garlic, fennel, and cumin
			- + Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper
		- Italian: garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and grated Parmesan cheese
		- Asian: sesame oil, grated ginger root, and soy sauce
		- Indian: cumin, ginger, coriander, pepper, and salt (no paprika)
- Roast in the preheated oven until okra is lightly browned and tender
	- 10 to 15 minutes.
- Lime Juice
	- adding lime juice to my okra stew for flavor, but another benefit is that acid will help the texture by counteracting the slimness a bit
